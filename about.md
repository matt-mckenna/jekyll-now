Hello!  I am a Machine Learning Engineer currently working at Spotify.  I primarily build cloud-based NLP applications but I'm also interested in recommendation systems, time-series data, and all things programming/engineering. 

## Current/Past Positions  (see LinkedIn for longer history)

#### Machine Learning Engineer (NLP) - Spotify (2020 - current)

I build, maintain, and improve machine learning (mostly NLP and NLU) models that power the Spotify Voice system and serve millions of users in real-time. 

#### Data Scientist - Amazon (2017 - 2020)

I worked on many ML projects as part of the "ML Solutions Lab" at AWS, including NLP and time-series. I also spent time in Alexa working on NLP/NLU models.  

#### Statistical Programmer - Harvard University (2013 - 2016)
I built statistical models to analyze clinical trail data for HIV research (see selected publications below).
